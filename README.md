This project aims at Multi-Class Classification of famous dataset FashionMNIST from sklearn.datasets. It involves Examining multiple models,
starting from Simple structure of networks, it builds on to pattern recongnization via Computer Vision by introducing Convolutional Neural Neworks.
This projects evolves with 3 models(Linear NN , Non-Linear NN on GPU , Convolutional NN on GPU).
Ivolves varies Data Visualisation techniques, Model evaluation policies and Data Pre-processing.
